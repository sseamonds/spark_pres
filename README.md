# spark_pres
Spark presentation and code for the Scala Meetup

Simple etl and ml examples.  Use case is featurization of raw session data and classification of sessions as likely leading to a purchase (or not).  Contrived but good enough for a demo. See links on last slide for help on spark and/or jupyter with spark.
